##### From Shruti on 9/16/18

# Just in case you could use a hint and didn't reach out to me yet to share your thoughts and ideas so far, or to ask for a hint. Here's the hint on *reverse words* homework assignment that is due tomorrow:
#1. Determine the starting index of a word and the index of the last character in that word (the next character will be a ' ' i.e. a space, or it would be the last character in the string)
#2. Call a helper method passing in the original input string, starting index and ending index of the current word.
#3. The helper method reverses all the characters from starting index to ending index. (edited)







##### Created baseline to review reverse_method once Shruti has posted answer!

# A method to reverse each word in a sentence, in place.
# def reverse_words(my_words)
#   # raise NotImplementedError
#   return nil if my_words == nil
#   return nil if my_words.length < 1
#
#   length = my_words.length
#
#   i = 0
#   # while the index is less than the length of the word
#   while i < length
#     # find the space and determine what to do with it
#     # assign the space to a variable introduce j
#     # while the index is equal to a space
#     while my_words[i] == " "
#       # i += 1
#       j == my_words[i]
#     end
    # while the index is less than j aka the space
    # reverse the word
    # while my_words[i] < j
    #   # while my_words[i] == " "
    #   #   i += 1
    #   # end
    #   # while my_words[j] == " "
    #   temp = my_words[i]
    #   my_words[i] == j
    #   j == temp
    #   i += 1
    #   j -= 1
    #   # end
    #   i  == j + 1
    # end
    # return temp
#   end
# end # method
